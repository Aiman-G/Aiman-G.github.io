 <h1> My Brain and My Albert Hijn</h1> 
</div>

Just a year ago, when I was new in this country called Eindhoven, I had a lot of questions, among them : where should I buy such and such?. 
My Dutch friend used to tell me, 'Go to your Albert Heijn, you might find it there.'
For those who don’t know: Albert Hijn is a chain of supermarkets all over the Netherlands, just like rain.

At the beginning, it took my brain a second to process this sentence. After all, I am not a native speaker, nor I have the mastery of a Dutch when it comes to English language.
Day after day, when I go to other places and look at their Albert Heijn, I started to compare it to my Albert Heijn. My Albert Heijn is in Geldrop, and there is another Albert Heijn in the city center, less than 70 meters away. At their Albert Heijn, they have chicken rice, a delicious ready meal that my Albert Heijn doesn't have. Do you know how painful this is?!
When I buy that delicious rice, I feel like someone is watching me from above my shoulder. I quickly enter, pick up my rice, pay with the automatic machine, and leave like a thief. I don't want anyone to see me at an Albert Heijn that is not mine. Cheating is shameful and guilt-inducing!

At my Albert Heijn, I know every face. I have even started saying 'fijne avond' to them instead of 'have a good evening.' Compared to their Albert Heijn, the girls at my Albert Heijn look like models, and the grandmothers are like my aunts—sweet and wise. It is my Albert Heijn.

In another country, one hour from here near Amsterdam Central Station, they have an Albert Heijn in a historic building. You won't believe your eyes when you enter that place; it's as if you're at the entrance of a museum. You can smell the history, the stones, and, of course, the bread. The good thing is that the interior is not as wide and open as my Albert Heijn, it is terrible. Only two people can barely walk inside. But the entrance makes me jealous.
In my resident permit, there is no mention of Albert Heijn.

 <h3> New Perspectives</h3> 
</div>

When I first heard "Your Albert Heijn," being a non-native English speaker, my brain interpreted the phrase in a very different way. 
"Your Albert Heijn" could mean that Albert Heijn belongs to me, or I belong to Albert Heijn. However, in context, the phrase means, as I now understand it,
the Albert Heijn closest to your house. This is how my brain now receives the sentence. The fresh perspective has been gained.

Many ideas in life become ingrained in our brains, making it difficult to see beyond them; they become second nature. 
Breaking out of these patterns is not easy. Language, as the primary means of communication, frames our perspective on ideas.

Serendipity, often referred to as a moment of unexpected discovery, is when our brains break free from these frames. It's during these moments that great people offer us ideas that shape the world.

There must be ways, beyond serendipity, to break out of these frames. However, our brains default to laziness as a means of conserving energy, a trait that was important during our days as hunter-gatherers.

I believe that traveling to new countries, experiencing different cultures, and learning new languages greatly aid in gaining new perspectives.

But why do we need a new perspective? To break free from the boring life. It's terrifying to consider that we only have one life, 
and it's entirely possible to spend it trapped in a frame that we unknowingly cultivated at some point.
Sometimes, I think of death as a state of mind, the final state of mind that becomes eternally attached to our souls. The last frame.

 <h3> AI and Perspectives</h3> 
</div>

What I have explained above, to me,  is akin to training an AI model on data, and after decades and then using the same model for decades without retraining it.
Creativity is nothing but old ideas that combined together to form a new one.
Go and watch any fantasy, anime, fiction movie. Look at those new creatures in the movie, if you disassemble any creature into its small parts, those parts are old, and well know for us. 
But combining those parts into a new one, created a new thing. 
In this context, I imagine the parameters of an AI model as neurons ( after all this is my brain frame, assuming it’s a deep learning model built with neural networks). 
There are electrical pulses that connect these neurons randomly to create new ideas.
Serendipity would be equivalent to retraining the model or finding a way to change connections between neurons (messing with model parameters).
