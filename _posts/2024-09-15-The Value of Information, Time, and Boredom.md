Singers—where do they find the melodies that compose their songs?
This question occupied my thoughts for an entire day as I wandered around the mountains near my grandpa's house.
I concluded that they must visit a melody shop, just like the one beside our school. 
And someday, melodies might be sold out, and no one will find music for their lyrics. No more beautiful songs.

What is the meaning behind the names of everyone I know in the village? 

Do people become afraid of death as they grow old? 

What lies beyond those distant mountains? What kind of creatures live there? 

Why do ghosts love dwelling in dark caves? 

Why does Grandma keep telling me, "Solitude is a kingdom," when I'm not a prince?

These and many other questions entertained me in those isolated mountains, especially during summer vacations. Often, I would converse with my few goats while herding them in the silent corners of the mountains. There was no other way to spend time, except for some leftover old books and magazines that my uncles left behind when they moved to the cities to chase their futures.

I was only in primary school when I would pick up a magazine and read everything in it. Then I'd read the second, the third, and the books—sometimes reading the same one three or four times during my summer break. Even months later, I'd return to those magazines, circling back to the same stories I had read before. If I found a new magazine or book, I would read it wisely, without greed. I wanted to leave something to read for the coming days. Every page had value—a lot of value.

Now, I can just click and download tens of books in an hour—valuable knowledge and a wealth of information from every corner of the world and time. I skim through them and leave them stored on my tablet. Time is still there—the same seconds and minutes—not yet sold out. But now, there are more things than a few goats competing for my attention.

I have never found myself wrestling with a simple question for uninterrupted hours without a laptop or writing. There is a whole world connected to my palm device; I am more than a prince—perhaps a slave too, at the same time.

I believe that bored people produced many of the great ideas we have today, and we may not be able to come close to their depth. We are quickly evolving into creatures with a severe allergy to boredom. Maybe humanity will never again produce deep scientific, philosophical, or political ideas as profound as those produced by the bored people before us.

Perhaps it is good to let AI take on this role—we are no longer fit for it. 

**Final note:** I decided to be bored for a few minutes today; that is why...
