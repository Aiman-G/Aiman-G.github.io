While listening, you will travel to villages nestled between mountains, to rivers hugging the hills like a silken qiyao ruqun dress. You can smell the damp soil of unpaved village roads, see the memories held in the footprints saved within their earth, and watch smoke escape the roofs of old kitchens, twisting like a Chinese Water Sleeve Dance. You can see the morning mist resting on the necks of the mountains.\nThe bamboo flute rises above a Chinese rural village and lifts you toward the sun. The golden reflection of sunlight on the river fills your eyes with a magical happiness. Then, other birds accompany you with the voice of the guzheng, tingling your soul with a smooth pleasure—a pure, natural joy.\nIt captures the duty of the bird returning to its nest before sunset, the joy of a mother receiving her long-absent child.\nYour mind can picture a feather in the hand of an ancient Chinese master, painting a watercolor (水墨画). You float with that feather, smoothly feeling the beautiful conclusion of the painting in its final stroke.\nThis is the soul of Chinese aesthetics, but in tones. There is no difference between Chinese music and Chinese landscape painting. If a piece of Chinese music does not evoke this feeling in you, does not paint the aesthetics of gardens, streams, mountains, sunsets, and floating clouds… of Nature itself… then it is not Chinese music. It is imported. Flat. Soulless.\nI love this song. Honestly, I love it so much that I do not need to understand a word. While listening to it on YouTube, I found Jiang Shan singing it recently on a Chinese show.\nNow listen. Jiang Shan still has that elegant, beautiful voice. But it seems the modernization of Chinese music—and all of our Eastern music—is trapped by a certain logic. Producers look for patterns, they use only Western instruments, they think Mozart is the definition of \u0026ldquo;genius,\u0026rdquo; superior to every Eastern melody. For them, westernizing your music is a civilized act.\nThey see nothing in music except patterns. The smarter the pattern, the better the music. This is precisely how the Western lens often views human aesthetics: as algorithmic.\nCongratulations. Now, this algorithmic, soulless music can be replaced by an AI algorithm. But you will never replace the original \u0026ldquo;Dreaming of My Homeland\u0026rdquo; with any algorithm. It comes from human consciousness—a consciousness that much of the West dismisses as merely an emergent property of brain chemicals.\nBy that logic, we are nothing but a set of mathematical relationships that can be simulated in a computer. Taking an iconic Chinese song and stripping it of all Chinese instruments is an act of assassination against the soul of Chinese music. It is an act of mimicry, as every single Eastern musician seems to do nowadays, whether in the Middle East or in China. They have nothing new to offer except the killing of an old beauty, replacing it with Western, flat, soulless, algorithmic patterns. They are robots, and they will soon be replaced by AI robots.\nA thousand Mozarts, each with a thousand lifetimes, could not come close to the four minutes of \u0026ldquo;Dreaming of My Homeland\u0026rdquo; or the few minutes of \u0026ldquo;Streamside Peach Blossom Spring\u0026rdquo; (《溪行桃花源》). Those artists and their music will live forever.\nThe modern robotic musicians will live and die like a trend created by a bot on a social media platform.\nHappy chinese new year \u0026ndash; Aiman\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/zh/posts/the_assisnation_ch_music/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e即便不解一字，当你聆听江珊的《梦里水乡》，思绪亦能挣脱束缚，自由徜徉。乐声将你引向山间的村落，河水如齐腰襦裙般环抱山峦。你能闻到乡村未铺砌道路上湿润的泥土气息，能看见足迹封存于小径记忆中的往昔，能望见炊烟从旧厨房的屋顶袅袅升起，宛如中国的水袖舞。你能看见晨雾如轻纱，环绕在山峦的颈项。\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chinese music"},{"content":"Welcome to my multilingual blog.

While listening, you will travel to villages nestled between mountains, to rivers hugging the hills like a silken qiyao ruqun dress. You can smell the damp soil of unpaved village roads, see the memories held in the footprints saved within their earth, and watch smoke escape the roofs of old kitchens, twisting like a Chinese Water Sleeve Dance. You can see the morning mist resting on the necks of the mountains.\nThe bamboo flute rises above a Chinese rural village and lifts you toward the sun. The golden reflection of sunlight on the river fills your eyes with a magical happiness. Then, other birds accompany you with the voice of the guzheng, tingling your soul with a smooth pleasure—a pure, natural joy.\nIt captures the duty of the bird returning to its nest before sunset, the joy of a mother receiving her long-absent child.\nYour mind can picture a feather in the hand of an ancient Chinese master, painting a watercolor (水墨画). You float with that feather, smoothly feeling the beautiful conclusion of the painting in its final stroke.\nThis is the soul of Chinese aesthetics, but in tones. There is no difference between Chinese music and Chinese landscape painting. If a piece of Chinese music does not evoke this feeling in you, does not paint the aesthetics of gardens, streams, mountains, sunsets, and floating clouds… of Nature itself… then it is not Chinese music. It is imported. Flat. Soulless.\nI love this song. Honestly, I love it so much that I do not need to understand a word. While listening to it on YouTube, I found Jiang Shan singing it recently on a Chinese show.\nNow listen. Jiang Shan still has that elegant, beautiful voice. But it seems the modernization of Chinese music—and all of our Eastern music—is trapped by a certain logic. Producers look for patterns, they use only Western instruments, they think Mozart is the definition of \u0026ldquo;genius,\u0026rdquo; superior to every Eastern melody. For them, westernizing your music is a civilized act.\nThey see nothing in music except patterns. The smarter the pattern, the better the music. This is precisely how the Western lens often views human aesthetics: as algorithmic.\nCongratulations. Now, this algorithmic, soulless music can be replaced by an AI algorithm. But you will never replace the original \u0026ldquo;Dreaming of My Homeland\u0026rdquo; with any algorithm. It comes from human consciousness—a consciousness that much of the West dismisses as merely an emergent property of brain chemicals.\nBy that logic, we are nothing but a set of mathematical relationships that can be simulated in a computer. Taking an iconic Chinese song and stripping it of all Chinese instruments is an act of assassination against the soul of Chinese music. It is an act of mimicry, as every single Eastern musician seems to do nowadays, whether in the Middle East or in China. They have nothing new to offer except the killing of an old beauty, replacing it with Western, flat, soulless, algorithmic patterns. They are robots, and they will soon be replaced by AI robots.\nA thousand Mozarts, each with a thousand lifetimes, could not come close to the four minutes of \u0026ldquo;Dreaming of My Homeland\u0026rdquo; or the few minutes of \u0026ldquo;Streamside Peach Blossom Spring\u0026rdquo; (《溪行桃花源》).
